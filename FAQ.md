# Welcome 

#### Q: Who is this community for?
-   You like to learn how things work
-   You are looking to expand your portfolio with a serious project    
-   You like making things from scratch    
-   You are interested in game development but are not in a rush to release a game    
-   You are interested in software engineering    
-   You want to become a graphics programmer

#### Q: Who is this community NOT for?
-   You just want to make games as fast as possible    
-   Or on the contrary, you just want to make an engine but doesn’t want to make a game (remember, the point of an game engine is to make games)    
-   You expect things to just work    
-   You expect someone to do things for you. You are here to learn, not to boss people.

#### Q: I don’t know anything about programming, how do I even get started?
You can pick up the basics of C++ by going through [https://www.learncpp.com/](https://www.learncpp.com/)
Or, if you want to jump straight in, you can go to [https://learnopengl.com/](https://learnopengl.com/) and use [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) as a reference manual.
Either way, **do  not rush**. Yes it’s tempting to come up to speed with everyone but this will come over time so don’t pressure yourself into getting good fast, this will only burn you out.

#### Q: Why make an engine from scratch instead of using Unity or Unreal or many others?
For educational purposes. Skills learned from developing an engine are not limited to game development and can easily be taken to other CS fields so you’ll have more choice down the line if you want to change your career path. It’s also easier to go from software engineering to games programming than the other way around. 

#### Q: I have heard that making a game engine is extremely hard and not worth the effort, is it true?
This is based on the assumption that the goal is to make a full game and have it published. Making games is hard already and it’s understandable that making an engine isn’t ideal in that case. However, our goal here is learn how to make games from scratch without worrying about a publishing deadline.

#### Q: Is learning OpenGL useful even if I plan to use a game engine?
This will definitely make you better at using other game engines as you'll better understand how they work at a deeper level.

#### Q: What language will I be using?
C++ is still the standard for game engines because of the massive amount of libraries available and its speed. You may also use scripting languages such as Lua, Python or Javascript

#### Q: What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It’s a fancy way of calling the packaging of complex functions into simpler function calls to make programs talk to each other more easily.

#### Q: Do I need to be good at maths to be good at programming?
Ah, the M-word, don't worry there are plenty of maths libraries written by maths people available out there so you don't have to write you own equations. It's a bit like using a calculator, you only need to know how to use it, of course knowing what it does under the hood is better but not strictly necessary. Also bear in mind that by the time you realise you need to learn some maths, you'll have no issues learning things like linear algebra. 

#### Q: Why a triangle?
Everything in games is rendered as triangles. If you can make one appear on screen, making millions more isn’t that much harder, relatively speaking. Everything else is just fancy piping to make things look pretty and usable.

#### Q: Will making a game in my own engine make it better?
It’s all down to how you use it. You may end up being more efficient at making an actual game with it as you’ll know how to use it since you made it. You are also more likely to create small but fun games (to test your engine) than wasting your valuable time pursuing an overly ambitious project that is way too big or not fun to play and giving up. 

#### Q: I’m feeling overwhelmed, what should I do?
Take a break and come back the next day. You need to let your brain rest to learn effectively. It's not laziness, the brain actually needs rest to build new neural connections. Be kind to yourself. If something doesn't click right away, just leave it for now. It's okay to not understand something even if it looks easy to someone else.
